# LLMind---LLM-Recommender-System
Choosing the right LLM is increasingly difficult as different models excel at different tasks.
This project builds an end-to-end, data-driven LLM recommender by analyzing sentiment from 2,440 real user posts, it learns which LLMs perform best for specific tasks and recommends models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini using a semantic, data-driven pipeline.
